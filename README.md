# trigger-framework
This is a simple Salesforce TriggerFramework sample based on Kevin O'Hara's famous framework [sfdc-trigger-framework](https://github.com/kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework). 
Altough many Flow based orgs may not benefit so much from it, I believe it adds some order to your Trigger structure, and it has a great impact on mostly Developer based orgs.
I always keep this at hand and use it whenever I find suitable.
